        <h2>Overall</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          As a whole group, we think that the project development during these 4 weeks went well overall, even though we had also encountered some challenges during the time. Firstly, it was a great challenge that one of our team members could not join us during our weekly meeting due to his sickness. An felt very regretful for not being able to take part in the offline meeting, but the team understood the situation, sympathized with him, and gave him a lot of support during his tough time. But, thanks to the social network, we were able to communicate with each other easily, even though one of our members got caught with Covid. Furthermore, another major drawback that our team has was the lack of preparation for the presentation. For starters, we did not spend enough time creating a proper presentation slide, so the slide was not as polished as we expected.
        </p>
        <br><p>
          After going through these experiences, our team has learned a lot of different lessons from these mistakes. The first lesson that we can learn from An’s case is that we should have responsibilities for our own health because if you have a problem, it will also affect the production rate of the group. Secondly, we must pay more attention to our time management. It is essential to finish work on schedule so that the project can be completed on time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As a team, after this project we promise that we will learn how to be more proactive and focusing on working as a team more than individually.

          After the assignment 3: Our IT Project, there are so many things that I can gain experience from, and the emotional level that I have spent throughout the group processes. I am glad that this project is a success when our project idea is a website about reviewing and recommending films for users. I can learn about basic web programming using HTML and CSS, they are very valuable knowledge for my study career in the future. They are time-consuming and uneasy to learn but the result is a good bargain, and I am not regret spending my time for them. On the other hand, time management is a trouble for me when I was doing the assignment. I was disappointed when I could not manage my timetable well, and because of that I felt overwhelmed at some points. I think that there are things that I need to learn more about time management. Despite all of that, there is one thing that I am totally surprised is the amount of study outcome that came from this assignment only in such a short time. I have learned about collaboration, critical thinking, report essays, and many things more regarding web development in just 2 weeks.

          During the assignment 3, I have noticed many event that gave me a lot of thought. Firstly, I was very shocked that though I am group up with random people, my teammates were very capable, and they are all able to handle whatever task given to them. I was very inspired after finishing this group project by my teammate and I hope that in the next group project, I am able to find passionate teammate like this and be able to give the team all of my effort again. Though most of the project went without a hitch, there are still some drawbacks that I have to deal with during the creation of the design of the website. Since I am not very familiar with website building, it took me a lot of time to research for a appropriate website layout and color scheme that is pleasant for the user to use. This is the first time that I had to design for a website layout myself, that’s why, I think that I have learn some new skill after this project, and I hope that I can use this website designing experience more in the future. After this project, I hope that I can improve more on getting acquainted with new teammate and be able to adapt with a new group working environment more quickly.

          After the assignment 3: I learned many things when I was spending time with my group and gained a lot of experience from our group project. First of all, I was worried when we decided that our group project is about web programming and I have no idea about web programming. But then, when we start our project, I learn more about the basics of web designing by using HTML and CSS. Now, I feel happy that our project is about web programming because it will help me a lot for my career in the future. I feel that spending time learning about those things is not time consuming and I do not regret spending my time on those. Even though I still have some trouble with the web programming since I have to learn and apply those learning into our project. It is also hard for me to balance the time for studying web programming and the time for our project so I kind regret that I cannot balance my time well most of the time. Overall, I was kind surprised with our project progress, since we need to learn a lot of new things in a short time. After this project, I believe that I will be able to collaborate with my team better, be able to think critically and be good at writing essays.
