        My full name Pham Hoang Thien An, my student id is s3818286.  I am currently enrolled in RMIT South Saigon campus as a student
        of the Bachelor of engineering program. I am well acquainted with 3 languages, which is Vietnamese, English and Chinese and
        can fluently use them to communicate with others. My favorite sport is Volleyball. I enjoy playing it with my friends whenever
        we can. After enrolling into RMIT, I immediately reach out and join the Volleyball Club in this university because I am very
        passionate about it. I have an older brother who is an IT specialist, and since my brother usually shown me about the beautiful
        world of IT, I developed an interest in IT at quite a young age. When I was at 10th grade, I start learning about basic programming
        language like PASCAL and C++ at school and extra class.</p>

        My full name is Tran Minh Nhat. My student number is s3924826. I speak Vietnamese mainly and English is my second language.
        I studied English because I know the importance of having another language that can help you a lot. I am now in my first year at
        RMIT University. I usually read light novels and play games in my free time, but I also play piano and go skateboarding. I
        discovered that the IT business offers such a diverse range of vocations and domains that it is incredible that a late-twentieth-century
        major can develop so swiftly. I selected IT because I believe this industry will be one of the potential leaders of mankind's science
        and technology. I had heard of the phrase IT for three or four years, but it was only five months ago when I was deciding on my
        university course that I began to explore some of its ideas. As a result, I must state that my senior year of high school encouraged
        me to learn more, and it was around this time that my interest was developed. Through half of my first semester, I have gained some
        basic experience of Python language, basic concepts of computer systems, and building simple websites with HTML. </p>

        I rarely do sports. However, I can play table tennis as it was compulsory in my secondary school. I love reading, from novels to articles
        or interesting facts about the world around us. My free time is spent on learning new skills, especially new languages. I am interested
        in AI when talking about my favorite field of IT. I have participated in some competitions, such as the WRO or the Arduino competition
        between high schools in HCMC.</p>

            Before going to RMIT, I was study at Golden West in California, US, due to family issue I had to go back to Vietnam and study in RMIT.

            soccer during my high school year. I love reading and listening to music. I discovery my interest in IT since I see this is a potential
            industry and I used to have a hobby to fix every one computer issues and it make me happy. I am current only having some basic experience
            with python language, and basic concept of computer system.</p>
