        <h1>Project description</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h2>I. Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Topic</h3>
        <p>For this project, we propose to create a platform that users can freely access to discuss about their favorite movie and get recommendation for new movies to watch. Currently, there have been too many movies produced, and the production rate doesn’t seem to drop. That’s why, there is a high demand for a platform that can recommend the user which movie that can fit the user’s movie taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the outcome of the project, we hope that after the next 12 weeks, we will be able to create a complete website interface with every intended feature implemented into it. The website will be hosted through a credible third company so that the user can access easily and the website loading speed won’t be affected the high rate of user’s access. Furthermore,  the website system must be secured from outsider threat, the user’s private data must be encrypted and store carefully in the server’s database, so that it won’t be stolen by Internet pirate.
        </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>2. Motivation</h3>
          <p>The motivation that helps us to create this website is due to our own boredom while searching for new movie to watch. Usually, it will take us hours of our precious leisure time to search for a movie to watch. Therefore, we planned to create this website not only to help other who had faced this type of problem like us, but it is also to help us find a good film to watch ourselves. In our opinion, this project will be a very fun experiment because the website’s movie rating won’t be affected by us, but it is affected by the community of user who contributed in judging if a specific movie is worth to watch or not. That’s why, we would love to see our project to come to fruit and experience the result ourselves.  </p>
            <br><br>
          <h3>3. Landscape</h3>
          <p>
            It is unarguable that our current project isn’t the first movie rating website to exist, there are many other movie rating websites that has been existing way before our project. Sites such as IMDB or Rotten Tomato are 2 of the names that will appear in many people mind when asked about popular movie rating website. Despite all odds again us, we still think that our movie rating website will leave special impression in our user since our website care more about the user and also influenced by the community more.
          </p>
          <br><br>
            <h2>II. Detailed description</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Aims</h3>
            <p>After the assignment 3: Our IT Project, there are so many things that I can gain experience from, and the emotional level that I have spent throughout the group processes. I am glad that this project is a success when our project idea is a website about reviewing and recommending films for users. I can learn about basic web programming using HTML and CSS, they are very valuable knowledge for my study career in the future. They are time-consuming and uneasy to learn but the result is a good bargain, and I am not regret spending my time for them. On the other hand, time management is a trouble for me when I was doing the assignment. I was disappointed when I could not manage my timetable well, and because of that I felt overwhelmed at some points. I think that there are things that I need to learn more about time management. Despite all of that, there is one thing that I am totally surprised is the amount of study outcome that came from this assignment only in such a short time. I have learned about collaboration, critical thinking, report essays, and many things more regarding web development in just 2 weeks.
            </p><br>
            <p> To accomplish the aim that we have set out at the start of the project, we have some goal that we need to finish. First of all, we need to focus in designing and creating a approachable and professional website layout first. The website design needed to be professional and simple so that the user can understand that we value their experience and wanted to create a place for them to search for serious and credible reviews. To be able to achieve that, color scheme act as the most important factor. Color psychology is the science of how color patterns can affect the user’s choices and behavior[1]. In other word, a single-color change can affect the likeliness of a user continuing to access the page again.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Secondly, another function of the website that we need to take account of is the login sequence of the website. Our goal is to create a smooth and simple login and sign-up sequence that the user can  handle comfortably. The user should be able to input their username and password easily and submit it to the server database without fearing that their data being leak or stolen. If the user hasn’t created any account yet, they should be able to click on a button to switch to a sign-up page and create an account using a username and a password easily.
            </p><br>
            <p>
Thirdly, an overachieving goal that we planned to do is to install into our website system a member ship program system. This system act like a meter of credibility of a user, this meter will determine if the user’s reviews of the movies is trustworthy or not. This system is very important to create a platform that the other user can know which review to believe in when they are browsing throw each movie.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Finally, the last goal that needed to be done is to create a personal list of movies to recommend for the user. As mentioned above, another function that we aim to achieve for our website is its ability to automatically create and recommend the user a list of movies that may fit into their liking. Therefore, we will need to implement an “Suggest” algorithm that can collect the user’s favorite genre and recommend the movies that both have good rating from other user, and with the same genre.
            </p><br>
            <h3>2. Plans and Progress</h3>
            <p></p><br>
            <h3>3. Roles</h3>
            <p>Lead developer is in charge of website development and most part of the project. Especially, our project is about website. Tran Minh Nhat is suitable for such adequate experience in HTML and CSS. Pham Hoang Thien An is qualified for being a user interface designer for most of the ideas of the project is from him including how the website looks like. A faithful assistant and dedicating staff member have to be responsible for the group tasks when he/she is given one, and Le Tran Duc Huy is the best match of all. Although, he is not in charge of the main parts, he can be active and helpful for the rest of tasks that are given to him. Finally, the Documenter and material organizer of the group, Doan Thien Di. Her attendance in the group is the biggest help for us because without her, we can barely divide tasks and organize them properly. Our group owns her a favor for her being a decent documenter. </p><br><br>
            <h3>4. Scope and limit</h3>
            <p></p><br>
            <h3>5. Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p></p><br>
            <h3>6. Testing</h3>
            <p>
              Since our group is not a professional at web programming, we are only thinking about website functionality testing and security testing. First, we do a links test since we need to confirm that any link that leads to our website works properly and there are no broken links or any link that leads to the wrong website or wrong page. Secondly, we test the performance of the website. We need to confirm that our login page works efficiently, there are no errors that occur when our customers want to create a login account or try to login in their account and we need to confirm that our customer can see other people review on our website. Thirdly, we will do the HTML and CSS test where we test if there are any HTML syntax errors and we need to verify that our site is available for the search machines. Finally, we will do the security testing, in this test we will simulate a malicious source attack to evaluate our website security and we need to making sure that there is no login ability if people enter wrong username or password and lastly, we also need to ensure that there are no restrict files are downloadable without appropriate access.

            <h3>8. Risks</h3>
            <p>Our project is about developing and publishing a website, and it is not always easy. One of the most usual challenges that could be an internal risk for our group and project is difficulties in learning to design and build the website in terms of UX UI Design, programming language (HTML, CSS, JS), database. Time is important in such a project as ours, and lack of experience in designing and building websites is certainly a threat to the general progress of the group. There will be copyright problems when our website is about reviewing and evaluating films. There will be thousands of other competitors that want to demolish our website, and so nothing is simpler than accusing us of copying ideas from their websites. Another risk is that this website will be vulnerable before cyber-attacks because we do not have a strong security for our data yet. Finally, it is the risk in our web services, which is the problem with the scanner system for checking the credibility of reviewers. Particularly, we will have to expect delays and crashes in response between the server and the clients because our website’s data storage is inadequate – we do not have enough funds to upgrade the database.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>9. Group processes and communications</h3>
            <p>It is certainly essential to establish a decent communication frequency between members of the group. The more detailed and specific the project is, the more meetings and discussions need to be conducted. Our group’s communication is considered inadequate, but it is not ineffective at all. Despite the lack of face-to-face meetings, we remain our discussions through Messenger, and it is efficient for now. In the future, when the demand for meetings for the project becomes vital, there will be more face-to-face meetings, 2 or 3 meetings a week. And there may be more, but they will be online discussions through Messenger including texting and video call. One of the benefits of online meetings is that they are easy to record and members who cannot attend will be able to catch up. The contact frequency can be various or limited, but the contact code of our group is “no matter how busy you are, at least once a week. </p>
